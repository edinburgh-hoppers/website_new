      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>
        As the official society for Gender Minorities in Informatics at the
        University of Edinburgh, our goal is to cultivate an open community with
        the aim to provide a supportive and inclusive society where people are
        comfortable and can build both technical and networking skills to thrive
        in the tech environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We differ from other socities at the University of Edinburgh in that
        <b
          >every woman, transgender and non-binary person studying or working at
          the School of Informatics is automatically a member of Hoppers</b
        >, so there is no need to become a member or to pay a subscription fee!
