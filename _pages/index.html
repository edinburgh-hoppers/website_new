      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>As the official society for Gender Minorities in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, our 
        goal is to cultivate an open community with the aim to provide a supportive and inclusive society 
        where people are comfortable and can build both technical and networking skills to thrive in the 
        tech environment.</p>
      <p>We differ from other societies at the University of Edinburgh in that every woman, transgender and
         non-binary person studying or working at the School of Informatics is automatically considered as 
         part of Hoppers community, and since from this year Hoppers society became one of EUSA societies, 
         people showing interest in our society need to obtain free Hoppers membership tickets through the 
         following link to verify their membership from technical side :</p>
