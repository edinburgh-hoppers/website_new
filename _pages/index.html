            <p>
                Hoppers is the Gender Diversity in Informatics Society at the University of Edinburgh. Named after famous female 
                computer scientist Grace Hopper, we provide an inclusive space for gender minorities to make friends, have fun, 
                and learn. All members of gender minorities who study informatics are members automatically, but we welcome everyone, 
                regardless of gender or degree!
