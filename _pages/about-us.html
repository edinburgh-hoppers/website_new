        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            As the official society for Gender Minorities in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, our goal is to
            cultivate an open community with the aim to provide a supportive and inclusive society where people are
            comfortable and can build both technical and networking skills to thrive in the tech environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            We differ from other societies at the University of Edinburgh in that every woman, transgender and non-binary
            person studying or working at the School of Informatics is automatically considered as part of Hoppers
            community. Since Hoppers became one of the EUSA societies, people showing interest in us can obtain free Hoppers
            membership tickets through the link below to verify their membership from the technical side.
