    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <!-- <div class="title-right"> -->
    <p>As the official society for Gender Minorities in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, our goal is to
      cultivate an open community with the aim to provide a supportive and inclusive society where people are
      comfortable and can build both technical and networking skills to thrive in the tech environment.
    </p>
    <p>We differ from other societies at the University of Edinburgh in that every woman, transgender and non-binary
       person studying or working at the School of Informatics is automatically considered as part of Hoppers
        community, and since from this year Hoppers society became one of EUSA societies, people showing
         interest in our society need to obtain free Hoppers membership tickets through the link below
         to verify their membership from technical side.<br>
