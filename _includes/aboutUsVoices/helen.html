    Diversity in computing isn't just about fairness—it's about better science and innovation. When we create inclusive spaces where underrepresented groups can thrive, we benefit from broader perspectives, novel problem-solving approaches, and stronger teams. Hoppers does essential work in fostering the supportive environment where all our students can develop their talents and confidence to lead in computer science and beyond.
