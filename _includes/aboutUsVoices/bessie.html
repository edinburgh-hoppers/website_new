    As the official society for Gender Minorities in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh our goal is to cultivate an open community with
    the aim to provide a supportive and inclusive space for people to build both technical and networking skills. The society has been created by a group of
    female teaching staff as part of the School in order to empower the women working or studying in the field.

    We partner with top tier companies such as Jane Street and Optiver to provide our members with the
    best learning opportunities and networks to build a future career. Because Informatics is a broad subject with potential both in
    research and industry, we are trying to diversify our events as much as possible. In order to do so, we organise a mix of social and technical activities, from speciality talks to socials! We build a strong community for members, and light their inspiration to become one of the best in the field. Our two biggest events of the year are Ada Hack, hosted in October, and International Women's Day, hosted in March. Every
    year we try to make our IWD better than ever. We have prepared a day full of interesting talks, workshops and fun challenges.

    The School of Informatics has offered amazing support to promote more tech opportunities to our members and to help
    them thrive. Hopefully, we will be able to get more and more women interested in Tech through our work.
