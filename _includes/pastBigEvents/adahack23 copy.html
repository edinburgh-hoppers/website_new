    We hosted another 12 hour hackathon in honour of the English Mathematician Ada Lovelace. 
    The hackathon aimed to celebrate our community's creativity while providing 
    a great opportunity for students from different backgrounds to work together in teams 
    and come up with innovative solutions to real-world problems.
