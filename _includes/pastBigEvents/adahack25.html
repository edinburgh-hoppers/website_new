<p> Our 12-hour Innovation Hackathon brought together creative minds for a fast-paced day of problem-solving, collaboration, and fun. Participants developed inventive projects around the theme of innovation, showcasing their technical and design skills. Alongside hacking, attendees enjoyed mini challenges like Mario Kart races, a “Find Ada Lovelace” scavenger hunt, and a thrilling assassin-style game, keeping the energy high throughout the day. The event was proudly supported by our sponsors, People’s Postcode Lottery and Optiver, whose contributions helped make the hackathon an inspiring success. </p>
