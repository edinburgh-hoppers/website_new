  Our annual AdaHack hackathon was back in 2024! Celebrating English Mathematician Ada Lovelace, this year's theme was 'Education'.
  With around 100 attendees, 50% of participants were from a gender minority, and it was 99% of participant's first hackathon!
  We had more challenges and prizes than ever before, and are really proud of all our participants' projects.
